#Creation Pattern
#### deal with object creation mechanisms, trying to create objects in a manner suitable to the situation
1.** Abstract factory pattern ** which provides an interface for creating related or dependent objects without specifying the objects' concrete classes.

2.** Builder pattern **  which separates the construction of a complex object from its representation so that the same construction process can create different representations.

3.**  Factory method pattern**  which allows a class to defer instantiation to subclasses.

4.** Prototype pattern **  which specifies the kind of object to create using a prototypical instance, and creates new objects by cloning this prototype.

5.** Singleton pattern **  which ensures that a class only has one instance, and provides a global point of access to it.
